All the popular blogs start with inspirational quotes, right?

Look, I'll be real with you - I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of this site is yet.  
Like I mainly started this cos I had an absolutely bananas issue with a Brother printer that I couldn't find a solution to online.  
When I did eventually figure it out I thought "hey, I should write this down somewhere so I don't forget it!",
which then evolved into "hey, I should write this down somewhere other people can see it too!" and well, here we are.

I'm also thinking about writing the odd review too, mostly for some of the more niche/obscure stuff I've bought that I struggled to find info on before buying.

Beyond that though I'm just gonna kinda YOLO it and see where things go.  

I'm not much of a "formal" writer either, so anything I do post will probably be pretty casual, don't expect any Pulitzer prize-winning stuff here üòÖ

Anyways, that's enough outta me for now.  
I'll catch you in the next post.
