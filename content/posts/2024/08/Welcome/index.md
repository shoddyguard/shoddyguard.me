Well hello there!

Today is the day I finally start my blog. Probably, maybe. _Hopefully...._  
I say that as I've tried this a number of times before but failed miserably to stick with it, I hope that this time will be different though.

I think I stand a better chance this time around as I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site which means I don't have to deal with any clunky CMSs.  
Plus I've already got a few pieces of content that I'd like to publish so I'm hoping that will help me get into the swing of things.

My main goal with this blog (at least initially) is to write some reviews and tips/tricks for a few products that are definitely more on the niche end of the spectrum.  
I really struggled to find any reliable information on these products when I was looking to buy them so I thought "why not write it myself?". ðŸ˜„  
In the future I'd also like to share some technical guides and tutorials too, I find it a great way to affirm my own knowledge on a subject and I figured that it may also be useful to others too.  

I'm not the best writer in the world but I'm hoping that this blog will help me improve upon that so please bear with me while we get started.  

Lots of love,
