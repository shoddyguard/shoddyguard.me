👋

Usually these pages contain a whole spiel about the author and the purpose of the site etc etc, but I'm not really a fan of writing about myself 😅 (who is amirite?)  
Besides, I don't think anyone is _really_ gonna get a good sense of who I am from just a few paragraphs on an about page anyways, I hope that my posts will do a much better job of that.  

I'm also not entirely sure what the purpose of this site is yet, I'm just kinda YOLO-ing it and seeing where things go.

With all that said, I think I'm a pretty chill dude and I'm always down to chat with like-minded folks, so feel free to reach out on any of the socials listed in the footer.

Peace ✌️
